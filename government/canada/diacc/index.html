    <blockquote>
      <p>Regardless of how the landscape evolves, the DIACC must have clear goals and actions to support positive strategic outcomes in line with DIACC members’ values, across the range of scenarios.<br />
[…]<br />
<strong>Potential future scenarios:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><em>Platform Identity</em></strong><br />
A walled garden environment where identity is used to keep the user on the platform (or group of affiliated platforms). The platform identity is made available for use in   other contexts but the aim is always to make the platform the center of the user’s digital life. Data about the user will be obtained from many sources and aggregated within the platform for its benefit. The commercial model is driven by the commercial model of the platform</li>
        <li><strong><em>Operator Networks</em></strong><br />
Groups of operators, typically from regulated industries such as financial services  or telecoms, form consortia to enable the sharing of identity and attribute data. Schemes are established around each consortium which govern all aspects of the identity and attribute sharing network. This includes requirements for participation, fees, and  liability. Identity and attribute data are obtained from known, vetted sources. The network still places a strong emphasis on privacy, allowing the user to have transparency and control of what data is shared and with whom.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Self-Sovereign Identity</em></strong><br />
Identity and attribute data is funneled through a wallet or agent employed by the user. Open and standardized frameworks allow the user to obtain verifiable and potentially trusted data from the parties it interacts with and share that data with other parties. Some parties are happy to provide verifiable data to the user without being paid. For other parties, commercial frameworks that add value to the data (e.g. by providing liability) will be developed potentially outside of the technical infrastructure used to share data</li>
        <li><strong><em>Open API</em></strong><br />
Data about the user is made available to the user through standardized open APIs. These APIs are provided by organizations in many sectors including financial services, energy, education, and health. They provide access to all types of data including transactional data as well as identity attributes that the user may wish to assert. The APIs enable the user to establish many independent bilateral links between the services it uses. Some APIs will be regulated and non-commercial, others will be commercial. Aggregators seek to simplify the ecosystem by integrating with multiple service providers.</li>

      <p>Toronto, May 6, 2015 – Imagine a world where Canadians can go online to access their medical records, open a bank account, sign a waiver for their children’s hockey camp, or even use their phone to vote.

          <p>A new digital identity system will allow us to do things online that we have traditionally used physical ID for in person. Preferably, the new system will also be useful for in-person based processes. It must allow for federation, preferably across both the public and private sectors since, in our everyday lives, we are much more likely to use our banking credentials than our passports. It must be robust, secure, scalable and provide no additional risk to personal information and privacy. It must also be privacy enhancing.</p>

          <p>This is a complex and costly undertaking—a task so complex and varied that it does not fully exist yet. Banks and other large commercial establishments can afford to build digital identification systems for their own customers. But what about using this identity to access school records? What about hockey camp? As a society we are waiting for a leader to step forward and create the digital ecosystem of the future. While we wait, institutions are building point-to-point solutions that are complex, limited and difficult for the user, and that introduce inconsistencies into an ecosystem that we know should be uniform in order to encourage adoption and security.</p>

We connected with their team to find out how PlaceSpeak is using digital identity solutions to transform community action and how people connect, contribute, and relate online.</p>

      <p>As opposed to social networks, civic networks are tied to place-based communities, such as streets, neighbourhoods, schools, stratas/homeowner associations and more. PlaceSpeak has been developing one such civic network that is not based on advertising or the data mining of users. It authenticates users to place, ensuring that they are real people – not bots. We believe that this is the future of online community engagement: hyperlocal and privacy-protecting, with the capacity to support respectful and authentic dialogue on wicked community issues, by design.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>In order to bring the proposed innovation to Identity verification one needs to simplify the verification question to “is the entity asserting the evidence the true owner of the asserted identity”. This can be achieved by matching attributes and features from valid and genuine evidence to the entity asserting the evidence. This is done millions of times each day when a user is asked to present ID; the features on their ID are compared with those belonging to the individual, be that by a Police office, Border control officer or liquor store owner.</p>

          <p>The proposed innovation will remove the risk of data breach by using secure methods that will not only ask for “what you know” but may also check “what you own”. Solutions include checking biometric or photographic information on government issued documents including passports or driving licenses and utilising challenge and response methods using Chip and PIN technology.</p>

            <li>increasing control and transparency when Canadians’ personal information is handled by companies;</li>
            <li>giving Canadians the freedom to move their information from one organization to another in a secure manner;</li>
            <li>ensuring that when consent is withdrawn or information is no longer necessary, Canadians can demand that their information be destroyed; and</li>
            <li>providing for the strongest fines among G7 privacy laws—with fines of up to 5% of revenue or $25 million, whichever is greater, for the most serious offences.</li>

        <blockquote>
          <p>As we start a new decade in 2020, the dominant method for authentication is still a password - the weakest link in the entire security model. The legacy of passwords is that they are targeted by hackers as the simplest way to break into a company to disrupt – or even worse, hold ransom - the targeted victim. Whether exposed from inside or outside the organization, passwords are the Achilles-heel in the security wall. <strong>Why?</strong> <em>Because passwords can be… Forgotten Written down Lost Shared Sold Stolen</em> And they are invisible, and that allows a hacker or fraudster to take over an identity.</p>

          <p>The biometric world offers a spectrum of options including iris, DNA, heartbeat, voice, gait, palm, and of course, fingerprint. However, these biometric options are not typically embedded in public identity documents, unless you happen to be a convicted felon and have been fingerprinted by the police.</p>

      <p>TORONTO, September 15, 2020 – The Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (“DIACC”) today announced the launch of the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (“PCTF”)</a>, a set of digital ID and authentication industry standards that will define how digital ID will roll out across Canada. Its launch marks the shift from the framework’s development into official operation and will begin alpha testing by public and private sector members in Canada. The alpha testing will inform the launch of DIACC’s PCTF Voila Verified Trustmark Assurance Program  (“Voila Verified”), set to launch next year.</p>

      <p>“The pandemic has pushed digital adoption five years into the future.

      <p>LOA is essential in determining liability and risk; offering a clear understanding how a Subject (customer or citizen) and a Relying Party (company or government service) can validate that they are who they say they are.

      <p>Since forming 1Kosmos in 2016, we have added some of the leading minds in identity management on our staff and board of advisors. We have multiple financial and telecommunications customers using our solution, and analysts have called the BlockID Solution the most complete solution in digital portable identity.</p>
