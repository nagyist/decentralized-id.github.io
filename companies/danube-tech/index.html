  <p>DANUBE TECH is a company working on technologies in the field of digital identity and personal data, including personal agents, semantic graphs, and decentralized identity.</p>

  <p>These emerging tools essentially place individuals at the center of their online relationships and transactions, and give us all the ability to create, manage, use, and destroy our online identities according to our own rules, and without delegating power to intermediaries.</p>

      <p>In a SSI proof-of-concept during the first half of 2018, 3 banks, an insurance company, the Austrian Post, and an institution representing notaries has cooperated to implement a range of use cases based on DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, Sovrin, and the XDI protocol. The use cases included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>digital ID onboarding for existing clients,</li>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I have worked on digital identity technologies for a long time, the question of who we are, how we present ourselves, and what do others know about us in the digital world. There’s this concept of user-centric identity, and more recently self-sovereign identity, which places individuals at the center of their online relationships and transactions, and gives us all the ability to create, manage, use, and destroy our online identities according to our own rules.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The term DID Auth has been used in different ways and is currently not well-defined. We define DID Auth as a ceremony where an identity owner, with the help of various components such as web browsers, mobile devices, and other agents, proves to a relying party that they are in control of a DID. This means demonstrating control of the DID using the mechanism specified in the DID Document’s “authentication” object. This could take place using a number of different data formats, protocols, and flows. DID Auth includes the ability to establish mutually authenticated communication channels and to authenticate to web sites and applications. Authorization, Verifiable Credentials, and Capabilities are built on top of DID Auth and are out of scope for this document. This paper gives on overview of the scope of DID Auth, supported protocols and flows, and the use of components of the DID Documents that are relevant to authentication, as well as formats for challenges and responses.</p>

      <p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs, see [1]) are designed to be compatible with any distributed ledger or network (called the target system). In the Ethereum community, a pattern known as ERC725 (see [2]) utilizes smart contracts for standard key management functions. We propose a new DID method that allows ERC725 identities to be treated as valid DIDs. One advantage of this DID method over others appears to be the ability to use the full flexibility of Ethereum smart contracts for key management purposes.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>There is a high level of interest in the Rebooting-the-Web-of-Trust community and beyond in “verifiable claims”, i.e. “a cryptographically non-repudiable set of statements made by an entity about another entity” (see [1]).

      <p>XDI (eXtensible Data Interchange) is a technology for modeling, storing and sharing personal and organizational identity data. One key component of this technology is the “link contract”, i.e. a “data sharing agreement between the publisher of the data, called the authorizing authority, and a party who wants to access the data, called the requesting authority” (see [3]).</p>

      <p>XDI link contracts contain a policy tree which is used to decide if the permissions granted by the link contract can be invoked by a requesting authority. This policy evaluates conditions based on input elements such as the authorizing authority, requesting authority, and an incoming request message. Simple conditions of the policy could e.g. require the presentation of a valid password or signature.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This tool fulfills a similar purpose as Bind does in the DNS system: resolution of identifiers. However, instead of working with domain names, we work with self-sovereign identifiers that can be created and registered directly by the entities they refer to. This is important, because identifiers are the basis for any identity and communications system — without identifiers, we cannot have relationships, transactions, data sharing or messaging between entities. Historically identifiers have always been assigned to us by some kind of corporate or state authority. The Universal Resolver lets us build architectures and protocols on top of identifiers that are completely self-sovereign. There is no longer a need for a central authority to issue, maintain and revoke identifiers.</p>

      <p>However, just having an identifier is not enough. We need some further information in order to know how to communicate with the entity represented by the identifier. The job of a “Resolver” is to discover and retrieve this further information. At a minimum, this information includes elements such as service endpoints for communicating with the entity, as well as the cryptographic keys associated with it. The Universal Resolver performs this task to enable the basic building blocks of a self-sovereign identity world.</p>

      <p>XDI (eXtensible Data Interchange) is a technology for modeling, storing and connecting any kind of personal and organizational data. Its underlying data model is a graph consisting of nodes and directed arcs. XDI is well-suited for digital identity that is distributed and heterogeneous. Through the use of mappings and connectors, XDI can be used to model even data that is not itself natively in XDI format (e.g. a Facebook profile, a government ID, or a record in a corporate database). Traditionally, XDI assumes a network topology that involves service providers and endpoints, e.g. a connection can be established between an individual and an organization through their respective endpoints.</p>

Every XDI graph can be serialized to JXD, and every JXD document can be deserialized to a valid XDI graph.</p>

      <p>An XDI graph is built from XDI context nodes, which form a semantic tree. In JXD, an XDI context node is represented as a JSON object, with an <a href="https://twitter.com/id" class="user-mention">@id</a> JSON object key set to the XDI context node’s address.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>XDI (eXtensible Data Interchange) is a semantic graph technology for modeling, accessing, and linking any data online. It is similar to RDF insofar as it is also based on triples describing a graph of nodes that represent resources (called “contexts” in XDI), properties that connect resources (called “relations” in XDI), and literals. Unlike RDF which uses opaque URIs (mostly HTTP) as identifiers and which constructs all semantics purely from the graph structure, XDI identifiers use an abstract syntax where semantics are established not only from graph structure, but also from the identifiers themselves. For example, in RDF an identifier for a person may be http://danubetech.com#markus, whereas in XDI, an identifier for a person would be =markus. XDI often assigns two or more identifiers to a resource, e.g. while =markus is considered a “reassignable XDI name”, a corresponding “permanent XDI number” such as =!:uuid:91f28153-f600-ae24-91f2-8153f600ae24 may also be assigned. Simply by parsing the identifiers, some limited semantics can already be extracted (“=” stands for person, “!” stands for permanent).</p>

      <p>Today’s Internet places control of online identities into the hands of third-parties. Email addresses, usernames, and website domains are borrowed or “rented” through DNS, X.509, and social networks. This results in severe usability and security challenges Internet-wide. This paper describes a possible alternate approach called decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI), which returns control of online identities to the entities they belong to. By doing so, DPKI addresses many usability and security challenges that plague traditional public key infrastructure (PKI). DPKI has advantages at each stage of the PKI life cycle. It makes permissionless bootstrapping of online identities possible and provides for the simple creation of stronger SSL certificates. In usage, it can help “Johnny” to finally encrypt thanks to its relegation of public key management to secure decentralized datastores. Finally, it includes mechanisms to recover lost or compromised identifiers.</p>

      <p>One of the most fundamental challenges for the PDE to consider will be the design and deployment of suitable underlying architectures for realizing emerging visions around the management and use of personal data. The basic organizational structures, according to which participants of an ecosystem exchange information with each other, influence many of its fundamental properties, such as privacy, security, flexibility, discovery, or the dependencies between different actors. The possible types of architectural patterns that can be implemented are highly diverse, with centralized structures on one end of the spectrum, and fully distributed systems on the other end. On the Internet, very different forms have always existed, depending on the infrastructural layer and the concrete applications and services one looks at.</p>

Ultimately the purpose of the PDE is to help us all make sense of the unprecedented amount of online personal data we observe today. It is about creating new business models and economic opportunities based on this personal data, which has been called a new currency, or asset. It will give individuals the means to control how this asset is used. In doing so, an awareness of the importance of privacy will develop on one hand and on the other privacy by design will become one of the key principles of the concrete solutions that ecosystem members are developing. In this article, we will offer a quick introduction to privacy and then move on to describe concrete resources and approaches to Privacy-By-Design, which is the idea of “baking in” privacy up front into the design of software architectures, rather than considering it a secondary or 3rd-party aspect of classic software engineering or deployment.</p>

In today’s interconnected world we see the emergence of a “global civil society”, which transcends national borders and attempts to solve global challenges that established political and economic structures fail to address. This global civil society is organized like a network, just like the global communication systems that produced it are also organized like a network. However, while popular social network services such as Facebook, Twitter and Youtube are often said to be powerful tools for peace and democracy, they are in fact highly centralized services operated by for-profit companies.

On the micro level, our personal identity includes features that are specific to us alone, such as our name, address, phone number, or our educational and professional curriculum. On a higher level, our social identity determines our role and position within a society. It includes our overall social roles and status, our friends, and our social responsibilities such as being a parent.

These technologies have greatly transformed the way in which information is being generated, processed, transmitted, interlinked and received. As a medium, they are cheaper, faster and more interactive than more traditional media such as radio or television.
