<p>The Sovrin ledger is operated by Stewards, trusted organizations within the ecosystem who have agreed to abide by the requirements in the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/">Sovrin Trust Framework</a> and are responsible for operation the nodes that maintain the Sovrin distributed ledger.</p>

<p>Stewards also, as a group, accept or reject any changes to the ledger-specific portions of the Sovrin open source code by virtue of that role. They thus provide a counterbalance to the Sovrin architects who maintain the Indy code base.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Manreet Nijjar and Henry Goodier became doctors to provide critical care and give support to individuals in need – from cancer diagnoses to life saving operations. They believe the best care is given when trust exists between two entities such as a patient and a healthcare professional; a physician and a hospital; or healthcare organizations. That trust is, in part, fostered by strict regulations; for example, doctors are required to be certified and accredited by multiple organizations. However, current regulatory mandates are upheld by repetitive, inefficient, and time consuming manual processes, creating large administrative burdens for over-stretched doctors and HR staff.</p>

      <p>Nijjar and Goodier recognized this challenge and created Truu, a secure, portable digital identity for doctors and healthcare professionals. Using Sovrin’s distributed ledger technology and W3C verifiable credentials, Truu modernizes the way medical services verify staff identities, qualifications and certifications, which in turn enables healthcare professionals to spend more time caring for patients.</p>
