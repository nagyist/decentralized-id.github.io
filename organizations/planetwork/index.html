        <blockquote>
  <p>Planetwork was founded in 1998 with the recognition that the only phenomenon growing as fast as the global ecological crisis was the global communications system and that with it, we could address the biggest threats facing humanity and the planet. - <a href="https://www.planetwork.net/about">About</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="planetworknet"><a href="https://www.planetwork.net/">Planetwork.net</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>In July 1998, at the height of the dot.com bubble, Jim Fournier, Elizabeth Thompson, Erik Davis, David Ulansey, Mike Vincenty and Heather Newbold founded Planetwork. In May 2000 the San Francisco based non-profit convened the first international conference focused on IT and global ecology at the Golden Gate Club in the Presidio.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>That seminal event spawned a conversation about the potential for an online social network for society. Brad deGraf and Elizabeth Thompson, along with other members of the emergent Planetwork community, initiated <a href="http://planetwork.net/linktank.html">LinkTank</a>, an invitational network that grew to include 50 information technology and media professionals, who met for two years in San Francisco and NewYork as a fiscal project of Planetwork. In 2002 the group commissioned three of its members, Ken Jordan, Jan Hauser and Steven Foster to write the <a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1068/988">Augmented Social Network (ASN)</a> whitepaper, published in the peer reviewed online journal First Monday and presented at the Planetwork conference in 2003.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[…]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the next decade, many of the developers in the Planetwork community sought to build decentralized personal data exchange on the Internet. An initiative led by Drummond Reed called XDI promised to provide a solution using XML. Jim served on the board of XDI.org for a decade and one of the most respected developers in the community, Victor Grey, held Planetwork’s seat on the XDI technical committee at OASIS.</p>

  <p>Planetwork was also the fiscal sponsor for Identity Commons, which launched the concept of (user-centric)digital identity facilitated by Kaliya Hamlin, aka Identity Woman, who created un-conferences and in turn co-founded the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW),still held twice a year at the Computer History Museum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[…]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Planetwork had also invested in a tiny startup that held the key social network patent, to keep it in the public domain. Reid found he was on that patent and acquired the company, resulting in Planetwork holding shares in the IPO. They used the windfall to hire, Victor Grey, to build a collaboratively curated network called Spherical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[…]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JLINC is neither a blockchain nor an ICO, but uses some of the same key innovations in a new way to provide “automated cryptographically signed contracts” that control the exchange and use of data between separate databases at separate domains across the Internet. The JLINC open protocol is held by the Planetwork Foundation at: JLINC.org</p>

</ul>

<p>San Francisco, may 12-14, 2000</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we enter the new millennium, two global phenomena stand out as the most dramatic aspects of our time: the dizzying rate of technological change, especially in the realm of digital information, and the staggering scale and speed of environmental degradation.</p>

  <p>The explosion of information technology is transforming the way we inhabit and perceive the earth. Planetwork will explore how the creative application of digital tools - visualization technologies, databases, and the Internet, among others - can open up new possibilities for environmental activism and positive global change.</p>

  <p>ethTv, true to its spirit, takes up Planetwork’s challenge, widening it to reach the Italian audience, with the aim of increasing an awareness that urges us to assume a responsible attitude towards such an important issue and envision possible solutions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The emphasis is on the forms of technology that operate in tune with and not against nature.
It introduces the idea that technology can be designed for better social and environmental performance, since it is human decisions that shape it or today’s problems are so complex that they can only be solved by creating a new future. Today, in ecology, the fundamentals of understanding are in turmoil: the application of theory of chaos, the principles of socio-biology and of Gaia, according to which the entire planet is a living organism, are challenging the conception that one had of the stability and evolution of ecosystems. A vision is emerging that looks at ecosystems as systems with an autonomous organization, where order and complexity are “emergent” properties and not mere accidents. And just as living communities they are able to remain independent of the species that compose them, since the latter can be in continuous evolution while the ecosystems are independent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The philosophers of science explained decades ago that it was not science’s job to prove truths. I thought this was the most profound shift in Western culture of this century. Bigger than the atomic bomb, bigger than the Internet. That we knew that no person and no culture possessed the truth.</p>

  <p>We are still conjecturing what is right and what is wrong, aren’t we? But now we also understand that this is a creative, living universe. Not an accidental universe. Not a mechanical universe.</p>

  <p>But if we recognize that the universe is conscious, intelligent, alive and all of us co-creators, what is our role?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As I pointed out in the title of my speech, I felt that virtual reality could constitute the atomic power of the human mind, without a doubt … it represents the end of the cycle, the end of humanity, because it makes it possible to completely dominate the person’s being and replace it with something else.</p>

  <p>In Perceptual Cybernetics there are essentially three pockets of information that make up the human experience: the realities outside of us, those within our psyche, and finally our interfaces - as Gibson would say, the flesh.</p>

  <p>Eyes, ears, nose, mouth are the realities that allow us to know the interfaces that are intended for us. There are two types of interfaces represented: the interface between the external world and the physical biology of the person, and that between biology and cognition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An unknown Jesuit, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, conceived a structure of planetary consciousness, ordered like the Internet 50 years ago: From the 1920s to the 1950s, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin sketched a series of works poetics on evolution recently rediscovered as the foundation of new evolutionary theories.</p>

  <p>Teilhard envisioned an evolutionary scenario characterized by a complex membrane of information that enveloped the globe and fed by human consciousness. Teilhard foresaw the advent of the Internet more than half a century in advance. He believed that this vast membrane would eventually agglomerate into the “living unity of a single plot” containing our collective thoughts and experiences. “Teilhard’s philosophy of evolution arose from the duality inherent in his dual role as an ordained Jesuit father in 1911 and as a paleontologist, a career he embarked on in the early 1920s. Teilhard soon developed a philosophy that married the science of the material world with the sacred ardor of the Catholic Church. Between the 1940s and 1950s, the Church was on the verge of excommunicating him,but the philosopher refused to stop writing as to abandon the Church. The rest of his work was published after his death on Easter Sunday 1955, causing a small upheaval in the theological world.</p>

  <li><strong>Consciousness: The Last Frontier</strong> - Peter Russell
    <blockquote>
      <p>We hear much of the new frontiers of the net, robotics, biotechnology and nanotechnology, but the greatest unmapped frontier of all is consciousness itself. Without consciousness there would be no science and no technology. Yet, as far as the current scientific worldview is concerned, consciousness is one huge anomaly. Integrating leading edge ideas in physics, psychology, and philosophy, Peter Russell shows that consciousness is a fundamental quality of the cosmos; and that the singularity to which our techno-cultural evolution is ever-more rapidly headed is the Omega Point at which we awaken to our true spiritual heritage.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In this panel, artist Char Davies, ethicist Carol Gigliotti and theologian Jennifer Cobb will address one of the thorniest and most powerful issues in the nascent dialogue between ecological and technological sensibilities: embodiment. Without a deep empathy with our own messy and complicated bodies, a genuine connection with the body of the earth remains tenuous. When this understanding is combined with the inherent tendency of cyberspace to abstract us from our embodied experience, a conflict quickly emerges. From their diverse and intertwined perspectives, Davies, Gigliotti and Cobb will explore the tensions in this issue as well as surface a variety of hopeful trajectories for healing the rift.</p>

How can artists utilize technology in ways that are critical of technocratic structures of authority and offer alternative modes of knowing and being? In what ways does the artistic use of technology - even in the most critical ways - unwittingly supporting the very technocratic structures of authority those efforts seek to challenge? How does the artistic use of technology follow the paradoxical formula of relying on technological means to solve problems caused by previous technological means?</p>

  <li><strong>Global Brain Roundtable</strong> - Jennifer Cobb, Duane Elgin, Jim Fournier, Pierre Levy, Mark Pesce, Peter Russell &amp; Erik Davis
    <blockquote>
      <p>Ever since Teilhard de Chardin first proposed the idea of the noosphere earlier this century, conceptualizations of emergent global consciousness have tended to describe the phenomenon in terms of a radical separation from nature. With the rise of computers, and especially the Internet, both the popularity of various concepts of the noosphere, and the tendency to see it as existing exclusively in human technology, in opposition to nature, have accelerated. This session will explore the relationship between emergent global consciousness and nature, and specifically address the question of the global mind waking up just in time to find its body - the biosphere - in deep trouble.

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Planetwork’s next large scale annual event will bring Ben Cohen from True Majority, Joan Blades from MoveOn, and other leaders of online activism together with a multidisciplinary community of social change agents and technologists who are using the Internet to organize for positive change in this election year. Themes will include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Internet Activism: Online Organizing Strategies Opportunities and Lessons for 2004</li>
    <li>Electronic Voting: Vote Early, Vote Often New Technological Challenges for Democracy</li>
    <li>Social Networking for Social Good: Linking Social Network Software as a New Global Commons</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In addition to programmed sessions, the event will offer an extensive self-organizing structure designed to promote communication, dialog and more effective networking among all participants. This ground-breaking InterActive component of this conference will provide an opportunity for participants to bring forward their own passions and for our extended network of communities of practice to meet, interact and work intensively among themselves and with each other. The facilitated self-organizing process begins here in advance of the live event and is designed to help catalyze collaborations that may continue well beyond. Topics are expected to span a wide variety of Planetwork themes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Social Networks and Civil Society The New ID Commons Technical Protocol</li>
    <li>Environmental: Proactive Responses to Global Warming &amp; Mass Extinction</li>
    <li>Digital Democracy: Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties from the DMCA to Touch Screen Voting</li>
    <li>Alternative Economics: Online &amp; Offline Strategies Complementary Currencies, Electronic barter &amp; beyond</li>
    <li>Independent Media from Blogs and RSS to DV and TiVo, new technologies for independent networked news</li>
    <li>The Real-World Game: Bucky’s Spaceship Earth meets Sim Earth a multi-player online game using real data to model future scenarios</li>
  </ul>
