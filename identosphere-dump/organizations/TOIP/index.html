<p>Three new TOIP Task Forces</p>

<p>The ToIP Technology Stack Working group is starting an - <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2022/07/20/announcing-artificial-intelligence-metaverse-technology-task-force/">Artificial Intelligence and the Metaverse (AIM) Task Force</a></p>

<p>More details are available at <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=19657312">AI &amp; Metaverse Technology Task Force – Home – Confluence (trustoverip.org)</a> (next meeting <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Calendar+of+ToIP+Meetings">8/4</a>)</p>

<p>The ToIP Governance Stack Working group is starting a - Governance Architecture Task Force</p>

<p>After the original development of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Architecture Specification</a> and ToIP <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf">Governance Metamodel Specification</a>, the plan had been to start creating layer-specific templates.  However the Governance Layer TF, led by Alex Tweeddale, Carly Huitema, and Kyle Robinson—with input from Stephen Curran— concluded that component-based templates made more sense. Thus the new Governance Architecture TF will launch based on the components in the ToIP Tech Architecture Stack</p>

<p>The ToIP Concepts and Terminology Working group is proposing starting a - Mental Models Task Force</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mental models explain in detail how a set of concepts are related within a specific domain—a “mini-ontology”</li>
  <li>They are usually documented both in writing and in UML diagrams</li>
  <li>They add much greater depth and cross-conceptual understanding than glossaries alone</li>
  <li>The CTWG is proposing to start up a new Mental Models Task Force in September if there is sufficient interest</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>The language consists of</p>

<ul>
  <li>International standard vocabulary for security and privacy frameworks provides roles and actors to govern the transfer of personal data.</li>
  <li>The active state notice and consent receipt - is a format for generating consent records from notice/policy - which provides people with information to use rights. .</li>
  <li>W3C Data Privacy Control Vocabulary and ISO/IEC 29100, Legal Framework Vocabulary</li>
</ul>

<p>This language can be used to auto generate receipts to process rights and negotiate terms ..  At Kantara we are working to use the standards to auto read the notices/polices to provide a conformance / trust assessment for people so they can see risk independently of the service provider</p>

<p>We discussed these projects and have some links</p>

      <p>As we’re looking to move from the current internet era towards this new era of digital trust, I think it would be helpful if you were able to give an overview of how we got here. Perhaps we can take a step back, before the internet era, and discuss the paper credential era — I think that sets a good framework for where we’re going with these new digital trust models.</p>

<p>“It is finally time we had digital wallets with digital credentials that work exactly the same way our real-world wallets do,” said Mr. Reed. “We can take and use them anywhere to privately prove just what another party needs to know in the context of a particular transaction. We don’t have to go through any third-party gatekeeper to do this. That’s the way it should work in the digital world too.”</p>

<p>Editorial: Kaliya thinks this is a terrible idea. It is based on the premise that identity providers (issuers of credentials) should get paid every time a person (the holder) presents the credential in their wallet, when shared with the relying party (verifier) I think this is toxic and we are just finally getting to aligned standards for the VC format and for exchange protocols - now some how we are going to rapidly add a payments layer?</p>

<p>NO this isn’t going to work it is going to create lockin to particular wallets for particular credentials. All because some bad entrepreneurs who are no longer leading their companies sold SAFTS to greedy investors. There is a mess under here that should be exposed further now that they are trying to push this model again. Lets just say I can’t wait for the investigative reporter to dig into the Sovrin meltdown from last year further to see what is really there. It could have all been left alone and I wouldn’t be talking about it - but they decided to push the model again.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>credentials can help reopen travel, reduce the costs and improve access to healthcare, streamline KYC and financial transactions, and help connect students with employers needing their skills—all while saving governments billions in the costs of connecting and protecting their digital infrastructure.

<p>The purpose of the HXWG is to examine the design features of digital systems, their governance and the business processes that support them, which make interactions or actors trustable, in the contextual and subjective experience of those using them.</p>
