    <blockquote>
      <p>from the plethora of federal privacy bills put forward, there are three standouts:</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/COPRA%20Bill%20Text.pdf">Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act</a> (COPRA) (Democrats) – Sponsored in November 2019 by Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, this bill is <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/what-a-federal-data-privacy-law-would-mean-for-consumers/a/d-id/1340433">considered by some</a> to be “GDPR-esque” and more consumer than business friendly.</li>

It also keeps information about children under 13 years of age safe. ”Beyond this it requires businesses to write their privacy policies in simple language.“</p>

<p>The sunk cost of centralized databases is not an obstacle to decentralization. Verifiable credentials can be easily layered onto existing systems for better security. They can be used as a tool for orchestrating complexities across multiple identity management systems and databases so that they become privacy preserving and fraud resistant.</p>

<p>If a business has had an annual revenue less than “$41 million, did not collect or process the data of more than 100,000 individuals, and did not derive more than 50% of revenue from transferring personal information” in the last three years, they are not considered a covered entity in this bill.</p>

<p>We must promote access to safe and affordable financial services.  Many Americans are underbanked and the costs of cross-border money transfers and payments are high.  The United States has a strong interest in promoting responsible innovation that expands equitable access to financial services, particularly for those Americans underserved by the traditional banking system, including by making investments and domestic and cross-border funds transfers and payments cheaper, faster, and safer, and by promoting greater and more cost-efficient access to financial products and services.  The United States also has an interest in ensuring that the benefits of financial innovation are enjoyed equitably by all Americans and that any disparate impacts of financial innovation are mitigated.</p>
