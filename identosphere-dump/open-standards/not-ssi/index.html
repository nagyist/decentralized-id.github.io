</ul>

<ol>
  <li>A identity standard’s adoption is driven by its value of the reliability, repeatability and security of its implementations.</li>
  <li>A standard’s value can be measured by the number of instances of certified technical conformance extant in the market.</li>
  <li>Certified technical conformance is necessary but insufficient for global adoption.</li>
  <li>Adoption at scale requires widespread awareness, ongoing technical improvement and a open and authoritative reference source.</li>
  <li>When Libraries/Directories/ Registries act as authoritative sources they amplify awareness, extend adoption and promote certification.</li>
  <li>Certified technical conformance importantly complements legal compliance and together optimize interoperability.</li>
  <li>Interoperability enhances security, contains costs and drives profitability.

</ul>

<p>I think what happens is that a first blank node is created for the proof, and since that node has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@container</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@graph</code>, instead of being able to trace the relationships directly from credential to proof to verification method…</p>

<p>Each proof is being treated as a disjoint subgraph, and the relationship is not being preserved during import… […]</p>

<p>I suspect this is solvable with a more complicated graph config: <a href="https://neo4j.com/labs/neosemantics/4.0/config/">https://neo4j.com/labs/neosemantics/4.0/config/</a></p>

<p>But I wonder if we might correct this behavior in VC Data Model 2.0, such that RDF representations don’t have this odd behavior when imported as labeled property graphs. […]</p>

</ul>

<p>I’ve instrumented the rdf-canonicalize library so I can inspect the order of execution, and it appears that what differs between my implementation and the Javascript one is the order of the permutations. The spec doesn’t say how the permutations should be ordered, and my intuition is that the order does indeed matter - though I’m happy to be corrected if I’m wrong.</p>

<p>So, here is my question(s):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does the order of the permutations matter?</li>

    <p>If so, what order should they be in?</p>

<a href="https://openid.net/2021/08/24/shared-signals-an-open-standard-for-webhooks/">Shared Signals: An Open Standard for Webhooks</a> OpenID</li>
</ul>

<p>The OpenID Foundation formed the “<a href="https://openid.net/wg/sse/">Shared Signals and Events</a>” (SSE) Working Group as a combination of the previous OpenID RISC working group and an informal industry group that was focused on standardizing <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/re-thinking-federated-identity-with-the-continuous-access-evaluation-protocol">Google’s CAEP proposal</a>. These represented two distinct applications of the same underlying mechanism of managing asynchronous streams of events. Therefore the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0-01.html">SSE Framework</a> is now proposed to be a standard for managing such streams of events for any application, not just CAEP and RISC. In effect, it is a standard for generalized Webhooks.</p>
